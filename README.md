## Getting Started

Use the following commands to get started in making a new repo:
- In File Explorer go to the respective folder you would like your repo to be within.
- Right-click and \"Open PowerShell window as an administrator\"
- In PowerShell, one may create a new folder/directory by saying `mkdir *name of repository*`
- Use command `cd *name of repository*` to change the directory and/or go to the created directory
- Once within the directory a new file may be created by use `ni *name of file*`
    - In order to list the contents of a current folder use the command `ls`


Now you may open the folder/repository in Visual Studio Code or your respective IDE and start working!
